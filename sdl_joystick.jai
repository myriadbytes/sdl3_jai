 * # CategoryJoystick
 *
 * SDL joystick support.
 *
 * This is the lower-level joystick handling. If you want the simpler option,
 * where what each button does is well-defined, you should use the gamepad API
 * instead.
 *
 * The term "instance_id" is the current instantiation of a joystick device in
 * the system, if the joystick is removed and then re-inserted then it will
 * get a new instance_id, instance_id's are monotonically increasing
 * identifiers of a joystick plugged in.
 *
 * The term "player_index" is the number assigned to a player on a specific
 * controller. For XInput controllers this returns the XInput user index. Many
 * joysticks will not be able to supply this information.
 *
 * SDL_GUID is used as a stable 128-bit identifier for a joystick device that
 * does not change over time. It identifies class of the device (a X360 wired
 * controller for example). This identifier is platform dependent.
 *
 * In order to use these functions, SDL_Init() must have been called with the
 * SDL_INIT_JOYSTICK flag. This causes SDL to scan the system for joysticks,
 * and load appropriate drivers.
 *
 * If you would like to receive joystick updates while the application is in
 * the background, you should set the following hint before calling
 * SDL_Init(): SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_ALLOW_BACKGROUND_EVENTS
